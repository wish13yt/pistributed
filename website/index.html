    <h1>Pistributed</h1>
    <p>Pistrubuted is an open-source server & client to calculate Pi with distrubuted machines. Get started by downloading the client and connecting to a server.</p>
    <p>No Pistributed servers are hosted by me except for the test server I use (which isn't public).</p>
    <p>Make sure you trust the server you are connecting to! I am not responsible for what servers host.</p>
